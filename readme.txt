Hello Dr. Crossan,

A few things came up whilst doing this coursework. Mainly in regards to the testing, it kept throwing up
a seemingly unsolvable error: "NoMethodError: undefined method `env' for nil:NilClass".

After searching online, apparently it has to do with Devise::TestHelpers and integration testing?

My other tests, however, seemed to pass fine. 

I tried to implement aspects, like having a superuser, that wasn't covered in lectures/labs properly
but ultimately I struggled to get it to work and back tracked to start over a few times.
